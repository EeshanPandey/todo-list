HELLO FRIENDS
after 4 years of intensive coding my project is finally done.
THIS IS A BRAND NEW APPLICATION DEVELOPED AND PROGRAMMED AND CODED BY ME.
I PLAN TO SELL IT TO GOOGLE AFTER MAKING A FEW MORE CHANGES TO IT.
I WANT TO MAKE A NAME FOR MY FAMILY AND BY FAMILY I MEAN MY GROVE STREET FAM! I WANT TO MAKE THEM ALL VERY PROUD OF MY ACHEIVEMENTS IN PROGRAMMING FIELD.
I DEDICATE THIS PROJECT TO THEM.
